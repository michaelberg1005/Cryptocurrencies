# Cryptocurrencies
Module 18 Work
For this challenge I used a combination of data cleansing/pre-processing on crypto currency trading data  to make it analyzeable. After pre-processing the data I used a statiscal process known as PCA to reduce to data dimensions to the 3 key principal components. After I clustered the cryptocurrencies with KMeans algorithm to clarify the best number of data clusters. Finally, I visualize the results to determine any patterns in the crypto data.
